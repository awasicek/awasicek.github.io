Try to get the longest/biggest series of hexes connected to your home piece!

Try to block your opponent or wall them off with your own pieces!

The object of the game is to have the largest set of contiguous colored hexes stemming from your home location.  In other words, whoever makes a bigger area connected to their home piece is the winner.  Score an additional point for each hex that you control that is contiguous with your home piece.


##How to Play

Players take turns placing their colored markers on any hex.  The first piece each player places is their home piece.  Each piece after the home piece is a standard colored marker.  You will only score points for hexes you control if they are connected to the home piece (either adjacent to the home piece, or adjacent to other pieces that are adjacent to the home piece).
